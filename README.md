# analysis_dashboard
This repository is for making the dashboard for analysing data to better understand the underlying pattern

## TODO
1. Do some EDA and add a menu option for that
2. Add some time-series classifier model for the prediction
3. Use standardScaling as taught in week_8 lecture jupyter notebook ( restore to normalization as the last resort)
