This repository is for making the dashboard for analysing data to better understand the underlying pattern


## Welcome to the data analysis dashboard made by KVS Mohan Vamsi (st20314789)

**Here's how to navigate the dashboard:**

1.  **Begin with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Navigate to the **`EDA`** page using the side tabs.
    * On this page, you'll discover how the raw data is filtered, cleaned, and processed.
    * Explore visualizations and statistical summaries to uncover initial patterns, anomalies, and valuable insights hidden within dataset.

2.  **Train Predictive Models:**
    * Once EDA is done, head over to the **`Prediction Models`** tab.
    * Here, you can select from various machine learning algorithms and train them on the processed data.
    * The goal is to build models capable of predicting different factors based on the learned patterns.
    * Press the train model_name button to train and then press the predict button the bottom on the page to see the predicted target variable value (PM2.5)
    * You can even toggle the input variable tot he model and predict to see how it effects the target varaible.
